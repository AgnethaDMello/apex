        <p class="BOintrotext">As opposed to the front-office, which encompasses direct patient contact, the ‘back office’
assists remotely in patient care by taking over the tedious and time-consuming
documentation and operational aspects which include all sorts of data-entry, handling
electronic patient records, scheduling appointments and follow-ups, capturing radiologic and
diagnostic data, generating medical reports, coding and medical billing, insurance
verification, remote faxing operations, accurately updating patient lab data, any book-keeping
and data-mining as necessary to ensure the smooth operation of the medical facility.</p>
<p class="BOintrotext">All such redundant work is delegated or entrusted to back-office entities which solely provide
these services at a fraction of the cost, thereby freeing time, space and personnel on site,
resulting in better patient care and satisfaction. It also reduces recurring operating costs and
helps simplify work which results in increased revenue and profits which is the main aim of
any business model.</p>
